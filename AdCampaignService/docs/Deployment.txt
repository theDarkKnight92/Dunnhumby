CI/CD Pipelines:

 a. Build pipelines each for generating artifacts for AdCampaignService and workers service.
 b. Deployment pipeline for provisioning infra - we can use ARM templates (Infra as a code model) to configure all the components needed.
    i. ARM template and corresponding pipeline to provisiom fra while onboarding a new tenant:
        - Template will have metadata for new Cassandra and Apache Flink instances and configs will be configured into the pipeline.
        - Template will have metadata to add new properties to config server for new tenant db connection details.
 c. Deployemnt pipeline for rolling out latest build on AdCampaignService.
 d. Deployemnt pipeline for rolling out latest build on Workers.

 e. API Gateway, Apache Kafka & Redis need to proisioned one time at the time of prod env setup which can again be managed via ARM templates.
    For infra configs like brokers or partitions in case of Kafka kindly update the same into deployment pipeline and trigger.
