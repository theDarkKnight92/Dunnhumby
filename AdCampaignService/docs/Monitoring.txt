For realtime monitoring of application perf, we can build an observability platform using:
    a. Prometheus for metrics collection
    b. Grafana for realtime dashboard and alerting.

Metrics to be collected:

Infra level:
    a. Memory Utilization - Service Instances, Worker Instances, DB, Kakfka, Flink, Redis
    b. CPU utilization - Service Instances, Worker Instances, DB, Kakfka, Flink, Redis
    c. Message/Event Backlog in Apache Kafka
    d. Processing Rate in Apache Flink

Application Level:
    a. Overall request traffic on the service.
    b. Success/Failure rate for overall traffic.
    c. Request processing time (latency) - P95
    d. Cache Miss/Hit ratio.
